# rql-to-mongo

Convert [RQL](https://github.com/swimlane/rql) into MongoDB queries

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/swimlane/rql-to-mongo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swimlane/rql-to-mongo)

# Example

```ts
import { MongoQuery, RQLToMongo } from '@swimlane/rql-to-mongo';
import { RQLQuery } from '@swimlane/rql';

const rqlQuery: RQLQuery = RQLQuery.parse('eq(foo,3)&sort(-date)&limit(100,10)');
const mongoQuery = RQLToMongo.convertRQLQuery(rqlQuery);

cursor = db.collection.find(mongoQuery.criteria, {
	skip: mongoQuery.skip,
	limit: mongoQuery.limit,
	sort: mongoQuery.sort
});

cursor.toArray(function (err, docs) {
	// ...
});
```

# Supported RQL operators

Only a limited set of operators are currently supported:

### Comparison

- eq(field,value): Mongo operator $eq. Matches values that are equal to a specified value.
- gt(field,value): Mongo operator $gt. Matches values that are greater than a specified value.
- ge(field,value): Mongo operator $gte. Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.
- in(field,arrayValue): Mongo operator $in. Matches any of the values specified in an array.
- lt(field,value): Mongo operator $lt. Matches values that are less than a specified value.
- le(field,value): Mongo operator $lte. Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.
- ne(field,value): Mongo operator $ne. Matches all values that are not equal to a specified value.
- out(field,value): Mongo operator $nin. Matches none of the values specified in an array.

### Logical operators

- and(rqlQuery1,rqlQuery2...): Mongo operator $and. Joins query clauses with a logical AND returns all documents that match the conditions of both clauses.
- or(rqlQuery1,rqlQuery2...): Mongo operator $or. Joins query clauses with a logical OR returns all documents that match the conditions of either clause.

### Paging operators

- sort(+field1,-field2): Sorts the results. + for ascending, - for descending.
- limit(maximum,skip): Takes two args: maximum is a number which indicates the maximum number of results to return. Skip is a number which indicates how many items should be skipped before collecting the results
- after(cursor): Takes a cursor identifying where to start the page of results
- before(cursor): Takes a cursor identifying where to start a page of results going backwards in the list

Note: Cursor paginating using before() and after() is not directly supported by MongoDB. It requires some extra code or another library such as [mongo-cursor-pagination](https://github.com/mixmaxhq/mongo-cursor-pagination) to use these.

### Field limting operator

- select(+field1,+field2,-field3): Select the fields with + sign and exclude with - sign

Note: Combination of inclusion and exclusion is only allowed while retrieving the documents without _id i.e. (+field1,-_id)

# MongoQuery

The result object which is used for querying MongoDB:

- `after: string;` The cursor identifying which item to skip to when collecting a result set
- `before: string;` The cursor identifying the last item when collecting a result set going backwards
- `skip: number;` The number of items to skip before collecting the results
- `limit: number;` The maximum number of results to return
- `criteria: any;` The MongoDB query criteria
- `sort: object;` The MongoDB sorting criteria
- `projection: object` The MongoDB projection criteria
